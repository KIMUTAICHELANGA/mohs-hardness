Mohs Hardness Prediction with PySpark
This project aims to predict Mohs hardness values using machine learning techniques implemented in PySpark. Mohs hardness is a measure of the scratch resistance of various minerals, with values ranging from 1 (softest) to 10 (hardest). By leveraging the features provided in the dataset, such as electron counts, atomic weight, and density, we will build a predictive model to estimate Mohs hardness.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various features related to the chemical composition of minerals, along with their corresponding Mohs hardness values. The dataset is stored in a CSV file (train.csv) and consists of the following columns:

id: Unique identifier for each sample
allelectrons_Total: Total number of electrons
density_Total: Total density
allelectrons_Average: Average number of electrons
val_e_Average: Average valence electrons
atomicweight_Average: Average atomic weight
ionenergy_Average: Average ionization energy
el_neg_chi_Average: Average electronegativity
R_vdw_element_Average: Average van der Waals radius
R_cov_element_Average: Average covalent radius
zaratio_Average: Average Z/A ratio
density_Average: Average density
Hardness: Mohs hardness value (target variable)
Environment Setup
To set up the environment for this project, ensure you have the following:

Python environment with necessary packages installed (numpy, pandas, pyspark)
Access to the dataset file (train.csv)
Preprocessing
We start by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame to inspect its structure and contents. Then, we initialize a SparkSession to work with Spark DataFrame. After reading the CSV file into a Spark DataFrame, we perform basic preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, data type conversion, and renaming columns.

Model Building
With the preprocessed data, we proceed to build a predictive model using PySpark's machine learning library. We split the dataset into training and testing sets, train various regression models such as Linear Regression or Random Forest Regression, and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.

Results
Finally, we evaluate the trained model on the test set and analyze its performance metrics. We may also visualize the predictions versus the actual Mohs hardness values to gain insights into the model's behavior.

Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Ensure the dataset file (train.csv) is placed in the appropriate directory.
Execute the Python script to preprocess the data, build the model, and generate predictions.
Future Improvements
Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters to improve model performance.
Incorporate additional features or domain knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.
Deploy the trained model as a web service or integrate it into a production environment for real-time predictions.
